# Lab 2: Identifying ML Problems, Selecting Datasets, and Drawing a Methodology Diagram

## Project Overview
This lab focuses on the initial stages of a Machine Learning project, including problem definition, dataset selection from open sources, and workflow planning.

## Dataset Summary
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)
- **Type:** Tabular (CSV)
- **Task:** Regression
- **Target Variable:** `charges` (Medical insurance cost)

## Problem Statement
The goal is to predict individual medical costs based on patient attributes like age, BMI, and smoking status. This is a Supervised Learning (Regression) problem.
